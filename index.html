        <p id = "about-me">I'm a third year studying Computer Science at Columbia University.
            I'm interested in software engineering (frontend, backend, full-stack, etc.) and game development.
            My goal is to create digital spaces that are both aesthetically pleasing and functional.
            I'm currently looking for a software engineering internship for summer 2026.
            When I'm not coding, I enjoy skincare, makeup, and recording my grwm's on TikTok. 
            I'm also interested in improving my Vietnamese and understanding my culture more.
            Get to know me more below!
